image to ASCII
=

this project takes a picture and converts it into ASCII using the `PIL` (pillow) and `imagieo` libraries to analyse pics.

it is pretty much like every image to ASCII program there is, but i made sure to pay attention regarding what background the picture will be put on (either light or dark).

massive credits to the [ASCII Art website](https://www.asciiart.eu/faq) because i knew next to nothing doing this project!

*i saw this project on tiktok so i decided to re-create it form scratch to learn!*
